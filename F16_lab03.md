###Description:

This project is a Texas Holdem emulator. The objective of the card game is to get the best hand and to win all of the opponents' chips.

###User Stories:

As a user, I have the option of selecting single player mode in the menu so that I can play a game against a computer. 
On a user's turn, you have the chance to bet chips, check, or fold.
Users can create or connect to a chat server so that they can talk to other users around the network.

###Assessment of project:

* The chat server does not work as intended. It does run, but only those who join an already created server can chat.
* Single player mode runs. The game can be played to completion.

###User Stories: Potential stores

* As a user, I can be an active member of a chatroom even if I'm the one that created the chatroom.
* As a user, I can join a multiplayer server so that I can play with multiple other players.
* As a user, I can play a game against a computer that doesn't fold immediately if I bet crazy high.

###Assessment of the README

The READEME file looks to be relatively comprehensive. One area in which it could improve is how the AI works.

###Assessment of the Build.xml file

The Build.xml file has relatively little descriptions. The environment and test descriptions are in need of more in depth decriptions in particular.

###Issues

There is more than enough issues to achieve 1000 points on the project. They are clear in terms of what the expectations are as well.

###Aditional issues

There are a few bugs in singleplayer mode. 

###Assessment of the Code

The code appears to be well organized. 
* There is a card class that makes all 52 cards in the deck by assigning each card a suit and a number. The deck class then takes all 52 cards into an array and then handles the shuffling and drawing from the deck.
* The Player class keeps track on wins, get chips and hands for the player, lets a player fold, and also make bets as well.
* The Hand class simply finds out information about a player's hand that the CompareHands class can then use to figure out which player had the better hand. The TableCards class makes the cards on the table accessable to the CompareHands class to use in deciding who wins. Currently, the CompareHands class only supports two players. This class should be easily changed to allow for multiple players. 
* The PokerSinglePlayer class sets up a single player game and also implements the computer a user plays against.
* The PokerGame class sets up the GUI of the game ans also sets up how to change turns and what a user can do on their turn.
* The PokerChatServer and PokerChatClient classes are the only two that are lacking in comments. The ChatServer tries to create a server. If it is created successfully, it returns the server's IP address to the user. The ChatClient asks for an IP address, and tries to connect to a server on the IP address that was given. If it is successful, it allows you to send messages, as well as read other messages other users on the server have sent.
* PokerMain sets up the menu that first opens when the game is started.
